## How to

Clone this project in any directory and type `npm install` to install all dependencies and to run the project just type `npm start`. It will start to listen at port 9000, open your favorite web browser at address [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) and start to code your game on `src` directory.

And to distribute your game just run `npm build` it will create the `dist` directory with all necessary files, ready to push to any HTTP server.
